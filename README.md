# deck-of-cards
Deck of cards example for CustomInk

This project is a library which represents a deck of cards as a Casino might use it. Decks are by default initialized as standard 52-card decks, but can be initialized from any collection. A deck offers functionality for drawing, inserting, and shuffling cards. It also allows custom shuffling methods to be passed if a specific method is desired.

Note: this card deck only allows for drawing cards from the top and returning them to the bottom. Cards are immutible.
